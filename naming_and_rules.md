## Trumping releases will now be a thing here

+++ Rules For TV

## TV

## Complete Physical Media

Full UHD or BD or DVD
A "full" or "untouched" disc is a 1:1 copy of the directory in a disc.
This directory contains all of the data in the disc.

Accepted file formats - ISO or RARd due to drive limitation


## REMUX

A remux is a repackaged presentation of the raw audio, video and subtitle streams of a full disc, which have been "[re]muxed" or “multiplexed” into a different container (ideally MKV). This is done for easier portability and playback. 

- Must use MKV container.
- Must include the main track only in the primary language.
- May additionally include an English dub if the title’s primary language is non-English
- As archivists we should retain the actual released remux and not create a "DIY" by adding or removing any streams. E.g., adding extra audio languages or dubs or even subs. 
- As remuxers as long as you keep the video, the original language and include at the minimum English subtitles, the remux will be accepted. Feel free to add an extra English audio in your personal release if the title language is not English. 

## Encodes

An encode is a transcode of a raw source, such as a remux. The video/audio are encoded in order to reduce filesize while simultaneously aiming to preserve the original source quality.

Accepted file formats 

- x264 - MKV
- x265 - MKV

WEB-DL

A WEB-DL is a remux of the decrypted audio/video streams found in a movie/show provided by an internet streaming platform such as Netflix or Amazon. The properties of the audio and video streams have exactly the same picture/sound quality as the original encrypted media.

- WEB-DLs are untouched so let them be that way. 
- All WEB-DLs are supposed to retain their release names, no renaming, no TRaSH Guides renaming as Plex or any other streaming frontend doesn't have any issue with the naming the way it is right now. 

Accepted File Formats - 
- H.264 - MKV
- H.265 - MKV, MP4

WEBRip

Traditionally, a WEBRip was an encode of the raw data captured from an internet video stream using an HDMI capture card.

- Only acceptable if a WEB-DL is not available. 
- Should be trumped as soon as a quality WEB-DL is released. 
- Exception can be made in case the WEB-DL really is not up to quality.

Accepted File Formats - MKV



## Not Allowed


Low-Quality Release - FGT, X0r, YIFY, ION10 etc

Redundant File(s) - Sample files, screenshots, NFOs, or anything else that isn't relevant to the movie/show.

Encodes with Lossless Track(s) - Encodes with multichannel lossless audio tracks in HD/FHD resolutions (UHD will be the exception)



Coexisting and Trumping

Notes: As contributors, we have all been in the game for a while and should now be able to differentiate between a high-quality and a low-quality release, so please also use your judgement when uploading contents. 

2160p
- One slot each are available for Remux and x265.
- Only H.265 format for 2160p WEB-DLs will be accepted. 
- WEB-DLs will be replaced by Remuxes when released. Exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis. 
- If a specific Movie/Show already has a Dolby Vision UHD Remux/WEB-DL, the Non-Dolby Vision release should be skipped. (SDR UHD releases can coexist.)
- DV+HDR (HDR only if no DV exists), DV only and SDR content get a one slot each. Total of 3 types can coexist for each UHD format (REMUX & ENCODE).
- Release from another BD region is allowed with notes and report after uploading as to why it should coexist.
- Different cuts, E.g., Theatrical, Extended, Director's or IMAX will have separate slots as well.

1080p

- One slot each are available for Remux, x264 encode and x265 encode.
- WEB-DLs will be replaced by Remuxes when released. Exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis. 
- H.264 is the preferred format for 1080p WEB-DLs. Exceptions for H.265 WEB-DLs can be made depending on the reason. 
- x264 WEBRips will be trumped by H.264 WEB-DLs unless WEBRips prove to be superior. 

SD
- One slot each are available for DVD remux and WEB-DL 
- The resolution should either be 480p or 540p. 
- No DVDRips are accepted without a valid reason for its existence.

**For ongoing tv seasons, make sure to add them under the Ongoing folder in contrib drive
Example: if The blacklist has 9 seasons complete and 10th is airing, the 10th season should be under the Ongoing folder whereas the others should be directly under TV Shows folder**

+++ Rules For Games

## For Games/Software

You can upload a more recent/updated release than the one already on the drive.
E.g. Dying Light 2 cracked by EMPRESS will be replaced by a non-denuvo release.


For the rest, there aren't any rules for this, just avoid dupes 

## Naming Format for Repacks:

1. Start with the full game title {if its a well-known franchise like Call of Duty(CoD), Need for Speed(NFS), Grand Theft Auto(GTA) et al then you can use abbreviations}, As Mentioned In The Original Repack Title (henceforth, AMITORT)

2. Next, inside (_ _ _) write:
  
version no./ build ID, AMITORT
DLCs if present and their quantity or name, AMITORT
no. of language depots present as MULTi'X', AMITORT
any patches, fixes or trainers if present, AMITORT
any bonus contents if present, AMITORT
Early Access, VR ready/capable or the game's platform, AMITORT

3. Inside another (_ _ _) write Slow/Fast Install or Monkey/Turtle Repack, AMITORT

4. If posting a switch emulated repack then write the emulator(s) present within [_ _ _], AMITORT

5. In the end, write the exact name of the repacker/ repacking team within [_ _ _]

**Things to avoid mentioning in the title:**

  
selective download and the selective size (as the submission must have all the archives and content)
update or version name musn't be added if the version/build number is already mentioned



**Not Allowed for Repacks:**

  
remove redundant files (urls/ .torrents etc) from your uploads.



N.B. - Remember to not skip any file labelled as selective/optional from a repack when uploading it so that they remain bit perfect to the original release. Also remember to keep the .nfo file if the same is present in the original release.

**Naming Examples:**
```
Beacon Pines: Collector's Edition (v1.0.2 + Bonus Content) - [FitGirl Repack]

Dying Light 2: Stay Human – Ultimate Edition (v1.9.0 + All DLCs + MULTi17 + Bonus Content + Win 7 Fix + Online Multiplayer) - [DODI Repack]

BONELAB (v30.09.2022 + VR Ready) [ScOOt3r Repack]

Cricket 22 (v0.1.2319 + Fiddler Patch) [ScOOt3r Repack]

Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Duology [Ryujinx Nintendo Switch Emulated Release] (v1.0.1, MULTi9) - [KaOs Repack]
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
## Contribution rules for Scene releases:

Folder containing the files has to be named exactly like the original release by the concerned SCENE group.

Allowed non-0DAY/0DAY formats are a folder containing either:

a ZIP file (in "Store" compression method) or an "iso" container file
the ZIP file also has to be named exactly like the official scene release
all original files (nfo / diz / sfv / rar / loose files) need to be archived in the ZIP format due to drive limitation
(do not zip if release contains only a singular iso and nfo)
the .nfo file must also be present outside the ZIP file.


Nuked releases must have the tag [NUKED] added to the folder name and a "!nuked.txt" file must be provided
containing the nuke history, or, if unavailable, the latest nuke reason.
Nuke reason can be obtained from dats.site
Nuke history can be obtained from pre.corrupt-net.org
If the release is unnuked, the [NUKED] tag is to be removed but !nuked.txt with a nuke history must remain.

```
Examples:
