1. Some people here think we will be providing them TD's for personal usage. That's not what this is. Instead we will be providing drive access for you guys to download .

2. Only gmails will be added , anything else won't be added.

3. Members can contribute in 2 ways 
    a) You can directly upload to the drive. (I recommend through Google Drive app file stream or any similar 3rd party app you prefer)
    b) You can clone from your source drive (if you have any) to ours.
Although we know, most of you prefer the 2nd method , unfortunately we can't add all your google groups to drive in the fear of getting rate limited .
So as a possible work around, download AirExplorer and Copy/Paste (doesn't consume your bandwidth). Even though it is 750GB/day

   Or wait when we able to set up a clonebot.

4. Members have to follow the upload rules that have been put up in ⁠movies-rules ⁠games-software & Here (Read Above ^). If you are still a bit confused don't hesitate to ping staff or a fellow contributor

Optional: We also have a NSFW drive where all @Deleted User uploads would go. If you want access to it , subscribe to NSFW role here ⁠roles and send your email there.
